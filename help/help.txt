tpm-nvtool is a command-line program for managing Trusted Platform Module 
(TPM) Non-Volatile (NV) memory. It allows you to "define" (create) and
"release" (destroy) stores in a TPM's NV memory component. It requires a
TPM that complies with TPM Specification version 1.2.

Usage:

* Creating an NV store

  --define --index INDEX --owner_password OWNER_PASSWORD --size SIZE \
    [--pcr PCR] [--permissions PERMISSIONS] [--index_password INDEX_PASSWORD]

  The parameters mean the following:

  INDEX           A valid NV index
  OWNER_PASSWORD  TPM owner password
  SIZE            Requested NV store's size in bytes
  PCR             A PCR whose value will be required to read or write to the
                  NV store; multiple PCRs can be specified through multiple
                  instances of this argument
  PERMISSIONS     A comma-separated string consisting of zero or more of the
                  following keywords:

                    AUTHREAD      Reads authorized by INDEX_PASSWORD
                    AUTHWRITE     Writes authorized by INDEX_PASSWORD
                    OWNERREAD     Reads authorized by OWNER_PASSWORD
                    OWNERWRITE    Writes authorized by OWNER_PASSWORD
                    PPREAD        Reads authorized by Physical Presence
                    PPWRITE       Writes authorized by Physical Presence
                    READ_STCLEAR  Cannot be read after a zero-sized write;
                                  will need a full TPM clear to unlock
                    WRITE_STCLEAR Cannot be written after a zero-sized write
                                  will need a full TPM clear to unlock
                    WRITEALL      Data must be written all at once
                      
  INDEX_PASSWORD  Password for reading and/or writing to the NV store; required
                  if PERMISSIONS has AUTHREAD or AUTHWRITE

* Destroying an NV store

  --release --index INDEX --owner_password OWNER_PASSWORD

* Listing NV stores

  --list [--index INDEX]

  By default, all NV stores will be listed. If INDEX is specified, only that
  index, if it exists, will be listed.

* Reading from an NV store

  --read --index INDEX [--size SIZE] [--offset OFFSET] [--hexdump] \
    [--password PASSWORD]

  The parameters mean the following:

  INDEX           A valid, existing NV index
  SIZE            Number of bytes to read; if specified, must be greater than
                  zero and no larger than the NV store's size; if not specified,
                  the entire NV store will be read
  OFFSET          Offset in bytes to read from; if specified, it must be such
                  that the requested data specified through OFFSET and SIZE
                  lies within the NV store; if not specified, an offset of 0
                  is implied
  PASSWORD        The appropriate password needed for reading

  By default, data read from the NV store will be dumped as is (raw) to the
  standard output, which in turn can be redirected to a file. If --hexdump is
  specified, data bytes will be printed in hexadecimal format instead.o

* Writing to an NV store

  --write --index INDEX --string STRING [--size SIZE] [--offset OFFSET] \
    [--password PASSWORD]

  The parameters mean the following:
  
  STRING          A null-terminated string that will be written to the NV store
  SIZE            Number of bytes to write; if SIZE is not specified, the entire
                  length of the string (not including the terminating null) is
                  written, provided it fits in the NV store
  OFFSET          Offset in the NV store to write to; if not specified, an
                  offset of 0 is implied
  PASSWORD        The appropriate password needed for reading

  You can also specify a file instead of an inline string as the source of
  data to write to the NV store:

  --write --index INDEX --file PATH [--size SIZE] [--offset OFFSET] \
    [--password PASSWORD]

* Locking an NV store

  --writezero --index INDEX [--password PASSWORD]

  If the NV store's permission attributes contain READ_STCLEAR or WRITE_STCLEAR,
  using --writezero will lock that store for reading or writing, respectively.
